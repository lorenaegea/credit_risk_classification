# credit_risk_classification
Module 20 Challenge - Georgia Institute of Technology Data Science and Analytics Boot Camp

Used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
Split the Data into training and testing Sets, created a Logistic Regression Model with the original data, and predicted a Logistic Regression Model with resampled training data.
